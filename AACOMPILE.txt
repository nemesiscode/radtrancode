Code compilation has been tested on Linux (32 and 64-bit) using the
Intel Fortran compiler (currently version 11.1.072), and also on Mac OSX 
using gfortran. 

The are two main things to look out for when compiling on different systems.
1) You need to know that depending on the system and the Fortran 
compiler, the record length, ISYS,which is set in radtran/rtm_util/isys.f 
needs to be set to either 1 or 4.
For gfortran on MacOSX you need ISYS=4. 
For Intel Fortran compiler on Linux, you typically need ISYS=1, although 
some versions of the ifc need ISYS=4. 
If you don't know, pick either ISYS=1 or ISYS=4 and see if the code works.
If it doesn't, choose the other one!

2) The code will look in the directory defined by radtran/rtm_util/datachive.f 
for the a whole load of reference files during a run. Hence, you need to update 
datachive.f to point to the right place before compiling.

To compile the whole code you need to follow the procedure:
1) change directory to FOVgreg/ and type 'make lib'
2) change directory to frecipes/ and type 'make lib'
3) change directory to radtran/makefiles/ and type 'makeradtranlib'
4) change directory to radtran/makefiles/ and type 'makeradtranbin'
5) change directory to nemesis/ and type 'make bin'
Note 1: if you're not doing MCS calculations you can skip step 1.
Note 2: if you've already compile the Fortran recipes library, you can
        skip step 2.
Note 3: on MacOSX, you'll need to install gfortran from somewhere such as fink. In
	the end I just grabbed a version from a website. You'll also need f2c in 
	order for gettime.c to compile. I got a build script from the following
	website, whihc worked fine.

Relevant compilation flags and environment variables used are:

Linux-64 - Intel Fortran 11.1.072
setenv FCOMP "ifort"
setenv FCFLAGS1 "-mcmodel=large -i-dynamic -O2 -cm -w -zero"
setenv STATIC_FLAG ""

Linux-32 - Intel Fortran 7.0
setenv FCOMP "ifc"
setenv FCFLAGS1 "-O2 -w90 -w95 -cm -w -zero"
setenv STATIC_FLAG ""

MacOSX - gfortran
setenv FCOMP "gfortran"
setenv FCFLAGS1 ""
setenv STATIC_FLAG ""

***** For additional debugging with gfortran try:

setenv FCFLAGS1 "-O -finit-local-zero -m64 -fcheck=bounds -fcheck=mem -fbacktrace -Wconversion 
-mcmodel=medium"
setenv FCFLAGS1_FOVGREG "-O -ffree-form -finit-local-zero -m64 -fcheck=bounds -fcheck=mem -fbacktrace 
-Wconversion -mcmodel=medium"
