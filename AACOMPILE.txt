Code compilation has been tested on Linux (32 and 64-bit) using the
Intel Fortran compiler (currently version 11.1.072), and also on Mac OSX 
using gfortran. 

The are two main things to look out for when compiling on different systems.
1) You need to know that depending on the system and the Fortran 
compiler, the record length, ISYS,which is set in radtran/rtm_util/isys.f 
needs to be set to either 1 or 4.
For gfortran on MacOSX you need ISYS=4. 
For Intel Fortran compiler on Linux, you typically need ISYS=1, although 
some versions of the ifc need ISYS=4. 
If you don't know, pick either ISYS=1 or ISYS=4 and see if the code works.
If it doesn't, choose the other one!

2) The code will look in the directory defined by radtran/rtm_util/datachive.f 
for the a whole load of reference files during a run. Hence, you need to update 
datachive.f to point to the right place before compiling.

Relevant compilation flags and environment variables used are:

Linux-64 - Intel Fortran 11.1.072
setenv FCOMP "ifort"
setenv FCFLAGS1 "-mcmodel=large -i-dynamic -O2 -cm -w -zero"
setenv STATIC_FLAG ""

Linux-32 - Intel Fortran 7.0
setenv FCOMP "ifc"
setenv FCFLAGS1 "-O2 -w90 -w95 -cm -w -zero"
setenv STATIC_FLAG ""

MacOSX - gfortran
setenv FCOMP "gfortran"
setenv FCFLAGS1 ""
setenv STATIC_FLAG ""
