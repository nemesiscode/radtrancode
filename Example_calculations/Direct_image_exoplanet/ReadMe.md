# Example of retrieval of SPHERE observations
_Jean-Loup Baudino, 27th June 2018_

## Data
the data are IFS spectrum and IRDIS photometry 
coming from [SPHERE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/sphere/inst/filters.html) of PDS70b ([Mueller et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180611567M))

Observations are in format: data point (pds70b.spx) + filter (pds70b.fil)

## Temperature profile
generated by Exo-REM (Baudino et al. [2015](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2015/10/aa26332-15/aa26332-15.html), [2017](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa95be/meta)) with model fitted on data

## Cloud
a grey cloud for this example

## Retrieval
retrieval of the surface gravity, the radius, H2O abundance and dust scale

## NB

### "Surface" definition
always check that the surface in pds70b.set correspond to temperature deep in the atmosphere

### Temperature profile
always have a temperature profile define in pds70b.inp even if not retrieve
