Subroutines used by Nemesis for non-scattering calculations that can't use
the implicit Jacobian calculation. Directory contains a number of subroutines
that are used here and also in cirsradg.

Executables are:
  CIRSdrv_wave, which provides a front-end to the c-k calcalation.
  Lbldrv_wave, which provides a front-end to the LBL calcalation.
