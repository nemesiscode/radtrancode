purpose:        General purpose optimised c-k RT routines in wavenumber
		space. Developed for CIRS data analysis.

SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS:
***************************************************************************

cirsconv.f	Convolves spectra calculated with k-distribution bins with
		a second convolution shape.

cirsrad.f	Core RT routine. Analagous to genrads.f

cirsrtf.f	Set up routine for cirsrad.f assuming thermal or scattering
		calculation. Calls subcirsrtf.f and then convolves output
		using cirsconv.f 

cirswf.f	Specialised version of cirsrtf for calculating transmission
		weighting functions using cirsrad. Used by Oxcirs retrieval
		code.

cirswfset.f	Looks like cirswf, but does not call cirsrad.f Only used to
		run layering subroutines and thus establish the pressures,
		heights and temperatures of the weighting functions.

close_scat.f	Designed to close any opened scattering files before
		next iteration of retrieval algorithm.

findloc.f	For a given monotonic array and 2 values, finds the
		indices of the array values contained by the passed variables. Uses 
	      	numerical recipes subroutines.

get_k.f		Reads in and interpolates to get k value at given
		wavelength for all the layers in the RT calculation. 
		Automatically determines wether to interpolate in
		wavelength.

get_scatter.f	Reads in scattering information from .sca file and puts into
		common block.

get_solar.f	Calculates solar flux using a look up table. The
		table is read only once per loop through the bins, with
		values stored in the common block.

get_xsec.f	Reads in x-sections from .xsc file and rearranges variables
		for use in common block 'dust' as opposed to 'dustspec'. 

overlap.f	This subroutine combines the absorption coefficient
		distributions of two overlapping gases.

rank.f		Monotonically ranks k-coeffs. Used by overlap.f

read_khead.f	Opens KTA file, reads in header,and returns record number
		for the beginning of the range of interest as well as temp
		and pressure ranges used. 

read_klist.f	Writes variables to common block INTERPK for
		subsequent use in CIRSRAD. 

spline.f	Numerical recipes routine.

subcirsrtf.f	Called by cirsrtf. Sets up normal run for cirsrad.f

subcirswf.f	Called by cirswf. Sets up weighting function run for
		cirsrad.f

subpath.f	Calls Path as a subroutine. Apparently identical in function
		to version in radtran directory.
