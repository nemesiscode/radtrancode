directory:      path
purpose:        layering routines for RT codes

SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS:
***************************************************************************
addgas.f	Add a gas to the array of gas IDs.

atm.f		Reads atmospheric path calculation details from *.pat 
		file and calculates path amounts etc.

cell.f          Reads cell path calculation details from *.pat 
		file and calculates path amounts etc.

layer.f		Calculates the layers specified by the *.pat file.

newlayer.f	As layer.f, but allows for limited range cloud decks
		specified by top and bottom atitudes, number of sublayers,
		and opacity in each layer.

mewlayer.f	As newlayer.f, but a bimodal size distribution in each
		cloud deck is assumed.       

complayer.f	As newlayer.f, but instead of specifying opacity in each
		cloud sublayer, a fractional scale height for the whole
		cloud is assumed. 

cloudlayer.f	As layer.f but has extra nims retrieval code
		specific definition of parameterised cloud
	        structure where 4 cloud constituents are assumed, wach
		with a bimodal size distribution.

clouds.f    	Subroutine to predict cloud structure in Jovian atmosphere
		assuming a Lewis-type model.

cubint.f        Subroutine using Numerical recipes routines to do cubic
		spline interpolation of a table

newgrav.f     	Sets the gravitational acceleration based on selected
		planet and latitude. Gravity is calculated normal to the
		surface, and corrected for rotational effects. The input
		latitude is assumed planetographic.

rddmod.f        Reads in a dust profiles for Path

rdmod.f		Reads in T/P/vmr profiles for Path

read_grav.f	Subroutine to read in planetary gravity data from
		'gravity.dat'

reflatm.f	Reads atmospheric path calculation details from *.pat
                file for a reflecting layer calculation and calculates
		path amounts etc.

sngatm.f        Reads atmospheric path calculation details from *.pat
                file for a single atmospheric path calculation and
		calculates path amounts etc.

spline.f        Fits cubic spline to input data array.

splint.f        Performes cubic spline interpolation.

verint.f	Simple linear interpolation routine.

wrlbld.f	Subroutine to output calculated paths, amounts,
		calculation details etc. to RADTRAN driver file (*.drv)


EXECUTABLES:
***************************************************************************
dust_profile.f 	Generates dust specific concentration profile file
		where specific concentration is the number of dust
		particles per gram of atmosphere.

parah2_profile.f Generates a para-H2 profile file

nemesisprofile.f Extracts a T or vmr profile from a .prf file and outputs
		to a Nemesis-format a priori file

mod_profile.f   Modifies a dust profile file by user-specified optical
		depth correction factors.

path.f       	Computes atmospheric absorber paths and outputs in a form
		suitable for reading by RADTRAN software.
		Reads commands from an input path file with extension
		.pat and produces an output driver file of the same name
		but extension .drv

profile.f	Reads in an atmospheric profile of temperature, pressure,
		absorber volume mixing ratios versus height and allows
		manipulation and plotting of the profile.        

write_path.f	User friendly interactive set up of *.pat files for
		general calculations

interp_prf.f    Interpolates a P/T/vmr profile on to a new pressure grid.
