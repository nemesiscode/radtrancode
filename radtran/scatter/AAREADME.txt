Scattering routines used throughout the radtrancode project

Executables:

Makephase	Calculates phase functions of spherical particles
		according to Mie theory and outputs these to file for
		reference by NIMSRAD. 
		Mie scattering computations use subroutine MIESCAT (& DMIE).

Readphase	Program to read in a PHASE*.DAT files

Normxsc		Program for normalising aerosol x-section spectra to OD at a
		specific wavenumber
