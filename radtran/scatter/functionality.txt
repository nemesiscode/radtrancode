SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS:
***************************************************************************
scloud8.f	Matrix Operator scattering routine, but now rather than
		enter the quadrature ordinate of the solar and viewing
		directions, the actual zenith angles are entered and the
		output interpolated to these directions. In addition, all
		the fourier components are summed to give a single output
		radiance.

scloud10.f	As scloud8, but scatterers assumed to be Henyey-Greenstein
		scatterers.  Phase functions (azimuthally averaged with
		successive fourier azimuth functions) are interpolated
		from tables precalculated by Spmat using
		interpspmat1.f 

scloud11.f 	Modified from scloud10, to include Rayleigh air
		scattering (Jovian air assumed)

scloud11a.f	As scloud11.f, but now Rayleigh scattering can be turned
		on/off with IRAY flag

scloud12.f	As scloud11a.f, but now all imu/imu0 combinations are
		returned for a range of zenith angles specified by new
		azi array. Actually runs at same speed as scloud11a.f,
		just doesn't throw away loads of stuff. 

scloud12_s.f	Same format as scloud12, but now does single scattering
		calculation as per banfield et al. papers.

scloud12a.f 	As per scloud12.f, but now computes output radiation at
		the bottom of the atmosphere (i.e. at the ground)

scloud13.f	Also computes radiance at the ground. Modified to
		calculate fourier components rather than calculate at
		specific azimuth angles. Also added IABS flag to turn 
		scattering on/off.
		Also added computation of fluxes. 

scloud14.f	As per scloud12. However has two more flags, jhg and
		jinterp which allow different types of phase function to
		be used and intercompared.

scloud14a.f	As scloud14, but returns fourier coefficients of
		radiance rather than values calculated at specified
		azimuth angles

double1.f	Current version of doubling code.

matinv8.f       Double precision matrix inverter optimised for scattering
                code.

matrices.f 	Contains the matrix manipulation routines: MEQU,MADD,MMUL

abend.f		Print error message and exit.

phasint2.f	Returns the phase function integrated over azimuthal
		angle, for a prespecified set of angles. Calculates all
		fourier componenents in one go.

hansen.f	Normalizes the scattering phase function using
		the method of Hansen (1971, J.Atm.Sci., V28, 1400)

phase1.f 	Subroutine to calculate the phase function P at a
		single phase angle CALPHA. P is normalized to 1 over all
		solid angles.

refice.f	Calculates complex refractive index of Ice 1H for
		wavelengths between 45 nm and 8.6 m.  For wavelengths
		above 167 microns, temperature dependence is included for
		temperatures between 213 and 272K.  Mainly intended for
		applications in Earth ice clouds and snow, not other
		planets or interstellar space;

add.f 		Adds the reflection, transmission and source function 
		matrices of two adjecent layers

addp.f		As add.f, but has simplifying approximation if the layer
		to be added is non-scattering

iup.f		Calculates interior upward intensities in the clouds.

idown.f		Calculates interior downward intensities in the clouds.

interp_phase.f  This routine interpolates phase information from
		the supplied PHASE.DAT files to the current
		wavenumber/wavelegth.

miescat.f	Calculates the phase function, scattering, and
		extinction coefficients at a a given wavelength for a
		specified size distribution using Mie theory.
		The distribution can be "modified gamma", "log-normal",
		or single particle size depending upon the input
		parameters.   

tempscat.f	Slightly modified form of miescat.f

pgjiscat.f	Old and nasty version of miescat. Used by VORTEX routines
		so maintained for now.

dmie.f		Performs Mie scattering calculation (spheres)

read_xsc.f	Modified routine for reading in dust cross-section
		files. Reads in wavelengths as well so that cross-sections
		can be interpolated

calc_pmat6.f 	Subroutine to compute the P++ and P-- arrays used
		by the Matrix Operator code.

get_hg.f	Reads H-G parameters from hgphase*.dat files and
		interpolates to required wavenumber.

get_hg1.f	Very similar to get_hg. Not apparently used by anything.

henyey.f	Calculates the H-G phase function from the coefficients
		f,g1,g2

henyey1.f 	Calls henyey.f and computes some sort k-matrix. Not
		apparently used by anything.

get_theta.f	Calculates scattering angle array.

rayleigha.f	Function to evaluate the Rayleigh scattering cross
		section using Atmospheric Radiation Liou (1980), p 79.
     		Modified with new data from Handbook of Chemistry and
		Physics 1996

rayleighj.f	Function to evaluate the Rayleigh scattering cross
		section for Jovian air using data from Allen (1976)
		Astrophysical Quantities

read_hg.f 	Very similar to get_hg but different call parameters and
		does not compute p.

interpstable.f  6-dimensional linear interpolation of precomputed
                reflection/transmission matrices. Based on numerical
                recipes routine polin2

interpspmat1.f	Subroutine to read in and interpolate PTABLE*.DAT files
		produced by Spmat.

refindex.f 	Subroutine containing (nr,ni) for a number of candidate
		Jovian ices.

subphase.f 	Subroutine which calculates phase functions using
		miescat.f and fits H-G parameters to them using subfithgm.f

subfithgm.f	Routine to fit a phase function with H-G parameters

readphlay.f 	Not apparently used by anything.

psphase.f	Function to calculate H-G phase function, plus a
		fraction F of dipole (Rayleigh).

fback.f		Function to calculate fraction of backscattered
		radiation from a single, scattering layer.


EXECUTABLES:

		reference by NIMSRAD. 
		Mie scattering computations use subroutine MIESCAT (& DMIE).
