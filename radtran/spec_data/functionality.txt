purpose:        spectral data base I/O and processing code

SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS:
***************************************************************************
fndwav.f	Searches line data base file for wavelength by performing 
		a binary chop search of an already open line data base
		file.

rdgas.f		Opens gas_info.dat file which contains the IDs of the
		gases which Radtrans can process, a list of the isotopes
		and terrestrial relative abundances, and the 4th order 
		polynomial coefficients of the rotational and vibrational
		partition functions.
 
rdiso.f		Opens isotope data file (file name already read into
		common by RDKEY) and reads in isotope mapping. i.e. the N
		isotopes of a gas are refered to by the integers 1 to N.
		The same integers are used irrespective of data base. The
		isotope identifiers in the data base file will generally
		be different. The isotope data file contains the mapping
		between the two.

rdkey.f		Reads in line data base 'key' file

rdkeym.f	Slightly modified version of rdkey, used by Convert_data

rdkey_band.f 	Reads in band data base 'key' file

rdkey_corrk.f	Reads in correlated-k data base 'key' file
		
edline.f	Subroutine to modify line parameters (limited options
		listed by edset.f

edset.f		Subroutine to prompt for which line parameter modification
		scheme to use.

partf.f		Uses four term polynomial fits to compute ration of total
		partition functions for use by line by line programs.
       		Representation is as described in Gimache et al 1990 and
		distributed with HITRAN 91

rdline.f	Reads line data parameters from a text buffer. GEISA
		84,92 and Hitran formats all allowed.

read_del.f	Subroutine to read in Delaye H2O data scanned from paper
		by J.T. Schofield.

read_yam.f	Subroutine to read in Yamamoto CO2 data scanned from paper
		by J.T. Schofield.

lblband.f	Calculates the Goody-Voigt or Malkmus-Voigt equivalent 
	        band parameters to line data by statistical analysis of
		the lines. 

write_band.f	Routine for writing a standard band parameter output file

read_band.f	Routine to read in a band parameter file.

read_bands.f	Slightly modified version of read_band. Also able to
		process the extended band parameterisation scheme adopted by Kam Sihra.

lines.f		Reads line data into bins.

liness.f	As above, but adapted for Radtrans method of doing line
		binning rather than Radtran
